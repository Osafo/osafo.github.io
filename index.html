      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>I am a humble, motivated, sensetive individual, determined to improve myself and create an environement 
        conducive to the mental and emotional well-being of myself and others. I work at a high school in 
        support of our special education piece. I have traveled very far, have been invited to prestigious 
        institutions and functions, and also worked as a faceless prole in those and other more anonymous 
        settings. I believe I am worth more than the money I make, and hope to live in a world where we 
        are all treated as such. I am a writer, dreamer, and octagenarian-at-heart.</p>
